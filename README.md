## FAQ ❔

**Q: Why are the chat logs saved?**  
A: So that the AI remembers things, and I’m adding a feature to load previous chats.

**Q: Is my API key saved securely?**  
A: No. If you care about storing it securely, make a suggestion in the Issues tab.  
*Note: If you want to know where it's stored, here's the path:*  
`C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\GPT_Minus`

**Q: Why does nothing happen when I click Send?**  
A: You do not have an internet connection.

**Q: My PC exploded**  
A: Buy a new one :D
